        <h4>1.Automatic Power cut-off timer using Supper capacitor </h4> <p>Designed an automatic power cut-off timer using supercapacitors ensures efficient energy storage and usage. The         TP4056 module charges the supercapacitors and stops once full charge is reached. An Arduino Uno continuously monitors the charge status via the TP4056’s status pins. Once the         capacitors are fully charged, the Arduino triggers a relay to disconnect them from the charging source, preventing overcharging. The stored energy in the supercapacitors is then         safely supplied to connected loads, offering a simple, battery-free power backup or energy delivery system.</p>
        <h4>2.Mitigating Employment Fraud July 2024-Nov 2024 </h4>  <p> Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a job listing being fraudulent, aimed at         enhancing job-seeker safety by identifying fake job postings.</p>
        <h4>3.Text to image converter using AI Feb 2024-June 2024 </h4> <p>Built an AI-powered application that converts textul descriptions into realistic images.</p>
